# 726_ND_Project
Course project from Theory of Statistic II
## Overview
This project will involve the process of applying theory of statistic in selected paper to a chosen dataset. By complete this project, I will be able to apply the concepts and tools in the course, gain experience in successfully matching model to data, demonstrate a high level of programming competence, explain the mathematical basis for the modeling methodologies used, and produce a detailed written report describing your process and findings.
### Topic Areas
Causal Inference and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
